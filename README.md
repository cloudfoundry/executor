Let me run that for you.

Executor is a logical process running inside the
[Rep](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/rep) that: \* manages container
allocations against resource constraints on the Cell, such as memory and
disk space \* implements the actions detailed in the API documentation
\* streams stdout and stderr from container processes to the
metron-agent running on the Cell, which in turn forwards to the
Loggregator system \* periodically collects container metrics and emits
them to Loggregator
